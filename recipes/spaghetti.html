    <h2>About This Recipe</h2>
    <p>This is one of my favorite recipes, found in the cookbook "Appeties" written by Anthony Bourdain. Don't be afraid of the anchovies, they add a deep umami flavor without being too fishy. This can be made using everyday ingredents found in your pantry. Don't skimp on the Parmigiano Reggiano. </p>
    <h3>Ingredents</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oil packed anchovy fillets, rinse, drained, and patted dry</li>
        <li>1 pound dry spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil (best availible, more to taste)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup flat leaf parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Grated Parmigiano Reggiano (more to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring pot of salted water to boil, once boiling, cook pasta until al dente</li>
        <li>Warm oil in large saute pan over medium low</li>
        <li>Add garlic, pepper flakes, and anchovies to oil, cook slowly until anchovies evaporate. Do NOT brown garlic</li>
        <li>Add parsley to oil </li>
        <li>Add pasta straight from water to oil, increasing heat to medium (the water on the noodles will thicken the sauce)</li>
        <li>Add olive oil and pasta water as needed</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Transfer pasta to individual bowls and top with grated Parmigiano Reggiano</li>

    </ol>
